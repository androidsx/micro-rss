The contents of this folder are expected to fall within one of these categories:
* Reference files, original images, etc. For instance, the original image from which the application icon was derived, which should be useful for future changes
* Files that are specific to this version, such as screenshots, or the latest APK
* History of files relevant to other versions. In this case, they should be namespaced with the version number (such as "1.2-main-view.png")
